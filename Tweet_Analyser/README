INTRODUCTION

	This project is about analysing Twitter data and doing sentiment analysis on the tweets using Python. The python script uses 
  OAuth to connect to Twitter and get the tweets. A basic website has been built using Flask which helps in connecting to Twitter,
  provide a search box for user to be able to search tweets on any particular topic and reflect the analysed tweets. For positive 
  sentiment, the tweets will be green in color, for negative sentiment they will be red in color and neutral tweets would be 
  reflected in blue.
  

INITIALIZATION

In order to setup the necessary code base for running the script, following steps need to be executed-

1. Run the DDL dump 
2. Setup the config.py and update the following and also any other parameters if needed -
	a. host, database, user, password for PostgreSQL database connection
  b. copy the positive-words.txt, negative-words.txt, incrementers.txt, decrementers.txt, inverters.txt
	c. the file paths under [file_path] section to reflect wherever the files have been copied
3. Create a folder called template and copy the .xml files into it
4. All the python packages mentioned in requirements.txt should be installed
5. Create an app in Twitter at https://apps.twitter.com/ (Eg. Sentiment Analysis - Twitter) and get the consumer_key 
and consumer_secret from the app settings and update in config.py. This Twitter app represents our app (Flask website) and 
helps in connecting with Twitter
