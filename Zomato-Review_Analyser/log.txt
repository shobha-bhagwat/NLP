Review: Ok ok place. Food was not so great, service was bad, they got all starters and main course together. Wouldn't recommend for a great fine dining experience as they mention

Review: We ordered some chicken snacks and it was not fresh.We told them to replace , they refused to do the same and told us it is like that. They even put that in our bill. Really disappointed with the service .

Review: Pathetic Service... Unresponsive staff.   Very careless towards customers... I order only for Biryani and they took 40 mins to serve... They are spoiling the name of Hyderabad Biryani....worst taste...
